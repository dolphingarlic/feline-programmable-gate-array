# Feline Programmable Gate Array

It is well-known that cats are four-stage finite state machines wrapped in fur: they can recognize their ownerâ€™s voice, move toward that voice, get distracted by red laser dots, and meow. As such, this project aims to build a robotic cat that can identify and move toward its owner's voice.

To achieve this goal, we use a Xilinx Spartan-7 FPGA on a RealDigital Urbana board. FPGAs are ideal for this project because they support a wide range of sensors and outputs (e.g., microphones and Bluetooth) and can process sensor inputs in real-time. Thanks to this real-time signal processing capability, we can implement features like sound localization that would otherwise be difficult on the traditional von Neumann architecture.
